# About me

I am a biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Zurich's [Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute](http://www.ebpi.uzh.ch) (EBPI). I have a PhD in Biostatistics (2008) and have been working as a statistical consultant on clinical and epidemiological studies for over 10 years. Most recently I have been working with epidemiologist on projects related to network meta-analysis, development of clinical prediction models, mixed models, and multiple imputation. Data analysis has covered a wide range of areas, including

- survival analysis,
- (generalized) mixed models,
- classification trees,
- cross-over trials,
- (network) meta-analysis,
- analysis and comparison of diagnostic tests, and
- analysis of dose-response data.

These projects have led to almost 70 publications ([pubmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=((((Zurich%5BAffiliation%5D)%20OR%20St%20Gallen%5BAffiliation%5D)%20OR%20Pittsburgh%5BAffiliation%5D)%20OR%20Gall%5BAffiliation%5D)%20AND%20Haile%20S%5BAuthor%5D) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UARLzyIAAAAJ)) in a wide variety of medical specialties (H-index 22 as of 11/2018).
