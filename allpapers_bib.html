  title = {Inference on Competing Risks in Breast Cancer Data},
  school = {University of Pittsburgh, Graduate School of Public Health},
  year = {2008},
  type = {Doctoral Dissertation},
  abstract = {While nonparametric methods have been well established for inference on competing risks data, parametric methods for such data have not been developed as much. Because the cumulative incidence functions are improper by their nature, flexible distribution families accommodating improperness are needed for modeling competing data more accurately. Additionally, different types of events present in a competing risks setting may be correlated, yet current inference methods do not permit inferring such data taking into account the correlation between failure time distributions. This work first presents two new distributions which are well-suited for modeling competing risks data. In existing inference procedures for competing risks data, it appears that the correlation between failure time distributions of competing events are fixed as a constant. In the second part of this dissertation, a novel approach is proposed which allows researchers to model competing risks data by taking the correlation into account by estimating it. The methods are illustrated by analyzing survival data from a breast cancer trial of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project. Simulation studies are also presented for each of the proposed new distributions. Public Health Significance: Competing risks occur often in many clinical studies, and must be accounted for whenever researchers are interested in only one type of event. For example, researchers may be interested in investigating only local recurrences of breast cancer, but must also take into account all other possible types of events as competing. Parametric methods are not currently as well established as other methods for competing risks data. Development of flexible parametric inference procedures suitable for modeling competing risks data would provide more accurate information, which will serve to improve patient care in clinical settings.},

  title = {Multiple Score Comparison: A network meta-analysis approach to comparison and external validation of prognostic scores},
  journal = {BMC Medical Research Methodology},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {17},
  number = {172},
  abstract = {Background: Prediction models and prognostic scores have been increasingly popular in both clinical practice and clinical research settings, for example to aid in risk-based decision making or control for confounding. In many medical fields, a large number of prognostic scores are available, but practitioners may find it difficult to choose between them due to lack of external validation as well as lack of comparisons between them. 

Methods: Borrowing methodology from network meta-analysis, we describe an approach to Multiple Score Comparison meta-analysis (MSC) which permits concurrent external validation and comparisons of prognostic scores using individual patient data (IPD) arising from a large-scale international collaboration. We describe the challenges in adapting network meta-analysis to the MSC setting, for instance the need to explicitly include correlations between the scores on a cohort level, and how to deal with many multi-score studies. We propose first using IPD to make cohort-level aggregate discrimination or calibration scores, comparing all to a common comparator. Then, standard network meta-analysis techniques can be applied, taking care to consider correlation structures in cohorts with multiple scores. Transitivity, consistency and heterogeneity are also examined.

Results: We provide a clinical application, comparing prognostic scores for 3-year mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using data from a large-scale collaborative initiative. We focus on the discriminative properties of the prognostic scores. Our results show clear differences in performance, with ADO and eBODE showing higher discrimination with respect to mortality than other considered scores. The assumptions of transitivity and local and global consistency were not violated. Heterogeneity was small.

Conclusions: We applied a network meta-analytic methodology to externally validate and concurrently compare the prognostic properties of clinical scores. Our large-scale external validation indicates that the scores with the best discriminative properties to predict 3 year mortality in patients with COPD are ADO and eBODE.},

  abstract = {The cumulative incidence function is of great importance in the analysis of survival data when competing risks are present. Parametric modeling of such functions, which are by nature improper, suggests the use of improper distributions. One frequently used improper distribution is that of Gompertz, which captures only monotone hazard shapes. In some applications, however, cause-specific hazard estimates have been observed with unimodal shapes. An extension to the Gompertz distribution is presented which can capture unimodal as well as monotone hazard shapes. Important properties of the proposed distribution are discussed, and the proposed distribution is used to analyse survival data from a breast cancer clinical trial.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Temporary drainage of the upper urinary tract by use of internal ureteral stents is a common procedure that is often associated with a variety of symptoms. The role of intravesical stent position in associated morbidity is controversial. Materials and Methods: The German version of the ureteral stent symptom questionnaire (USSQ) was completed by 73 patients with an indwelling ureteral stent the day before stent removal. Intravesical stent position was classified into 3 categories by x-ray before stent removal. The influence of intravesical stent position on USSQ score was analyzed, including subscores and single items. Results: Intravesical stent position showed no significant influence on associated morbidity. The median USSQ total score in all patients was 77.5 (range, 30-147). Patients with ipsilateral stents (69.0; range, 30-122) tended to have lower total scores than did those with tangential (86.5; range, 30-122) or contralateral (77.0; range, 31-147) stents, but the differences were not statistically significant (p=0.35). The USSQ subscores for urinary symptoms (p=0.80), body pain (p=0.80), general health (p=0.16), work performance (p=0.07), additional problems (p=0.81), and all of the USSQ single items of interest in the context of stent length also did not differ significantly between the three groups. Conclusions: Intravesical stent position did not significantly influence associated morbidity in our study. An appropriate stent length should be chosen to avoid dislocation. However, complex calculations of optimum stent length, time-consuming manipulations, and costly stock holding of various stent sizes to obtain the perfect stent position do not seem worthwhile.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence of patient education on symptoms and problems caused by ureteral stents. METHODS: The German version of the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire was completed by 74 patients with unilateral inserted indwelling stents. Additionally, six self-developed questions regarding type and quality of patient education on pain, urinary symptoms, hematuria, activities permitted, stent function and overall patient education were answered. Correlations between questionnaires, subscores and single items, and the influence on economic aspects were analyzed. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, sex, intravesical stent length, stent indwelling time, use of analgesics and an alpha-blocker, the correlation between the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire and self-developed questions was -0.40 (95\% CI -0.58, -0.19, P < 0.001). The following subscores and items showed a statistically significant correlation with quality of patient education after correction for multiple testing: Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire total score, urinary symptoms subscore, U6, U10, G3, G4 and GQ. No relevant influence of patient education on economic aspects was found. CONCLUSION: High-quality patient education on ureteral stent-related symptoms is highly advisable, as it has the potential to reduce these symptoms. However, the influence of information on the incidence and extent of potential problems seems to be limited. A much better approach would be to develop better designed devices and more convenient stent-free procedures.},

  abstract = {Background: Sugar-sweetened beverages ({SSB}s) have unfavorable effects on glucose and lipid metabolism if consumed in high quantities by obese subjects, but the effect of lower doses in normal-weight subjects is less clear. Objective: The aim was to investigate the effects of {SSB}s consumed in small to moderate quantities for 3 wk on {LDL} particle distribution and on other parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism as well as on inflammatory markers in healthy young men. Design: Twenty-nine subjects were studied in a prospective, randomized, controlled crossover trial. Six 3-wk interventions were assigned in random order as follows: 600 m{L} {SSB}s containing 1)40 g fructose/d [medium fructose ({MF})], 2) 80 g fructose/d [high fructose ({HF})], 3) 40 g glucose/d [medium glucose ({MG})], 4) 80 g glucose/d [high glucose ({HG})], 5) 80 g sucrose/d [high sucrose ({HS})], or 6) dietary advice to consume low amounts of fructose. Outcome parameters were measured at baseline and after each intervention. Results: {LDL} particle size was reduced after {HF} by -0.51 nm (95\% CI: -0.19, -0.82 nm) and after {HS} by -0.43 nm (95\% CI: -0.12, -0.74; P < 0.05 for both). Similarly, a more atherogenic {LDL} subclass distribution was seen when fructose-containing {SSB}s were consumed ({MF}, {HF}, and {HS}: P < 0.05). Fasting glucose and high-sensitivity {C}-reactive protein (hs-{CRP}) increased significantly after all interventions (by 4-9\% and 60-109\%, respectively; P < 0.05); leptin increased during interventions with {SSB}s containing glucose only ({MG} and {HG}: P < 0.05). Conclusion: The present data show potentially harmful effects of low to moderate consumption of {SSB}s on markers of cardiovascular risk such as LDL particles, fasting glucose, and hs-{CRP} within just 3 wk in healthy young men, which is of particular significance for young consumers. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01021969.},

  journal = {Annals of Surgical Oncology},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {18},
  number = {10},
  pages = {2732--2738},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Long-term results of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in early (T1/T2) oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in a single-institution experience. METHODS: Prospective consecutive cohort analysis of 79 patients (67\% male, median age 60 years, age range 34-87 years) included between 2000 and 2006. Lymphatic mapping consisted of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT), and intraoperative use of a handheld gamma probe. Endpoints of the study were neck control rate, overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 79 patients (37\%) had positive sentinel nodes (SN). Six of 29 (21\%) patients showed isolated tumor cells, 14/29 (48\%) micrometastases, and 9/29 (31\%) macrometastases. OS, DFS, and DSS at 5 years for the entire cohort were 80, 85, and 87\%, for SN-negative patients were 88, 96, and 96\%, and for SN-positive patients were 74, 73, and 77\%, respectively. Only the difference in DSS achieved statistical significance. The neck control rate after 5 years was 96\% in SN-negative and 74\% in SN-positive patients. This difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: SNB is a safe and accurate staging modality to select patients with clinically stage I/II OSCC with occult lymph node disease for elective neck dissection (END). The promising reported short-term results have been sustained by long-term follow-up. Patients with negative SN and no END achieve an excellent neck control rate which compares favorably with reports on primary END. The neck control rate in SN-negative patients is superior to that in SN-positive patients, which is reflected in superior DSS.},

  abstract = {Background: Analysis of the lymphatic drainage pattern, the reliability of a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), as well as the impact of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases on regional control and survival in patients with early stage oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Methods: A prospective consecutive cohort analysis was conducted which included 111 patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2010. Endpoints of the study were neck control rate, overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS), depending on the size of occult metastases. Results: Forty-nine of 111 patients (38\%) had positive SLNs, 10 had isolated tumor cells (ITCs), 19 had micrometastases, and 13 had macrometastases. OS, DSS, and DFS at 3 years for SLN-negative and SLN-positive patients was 98\% and 71\%, 95\% and 76\%, and 98\% and 73\%, respectively. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant difference between the SLN-negative group and ITCs in DSS as well as between the SLN-negative group and patients with micrometastases in OS and DSS and between the SLN-negative group and patients with macrometastases in all 3 survival estimates. Conclusion Our study is the first to demonstrate that even small tumor deposits only detectable by the extensive histopathologic workup of the SLNB protocol have a significant impact on tumor control and survival in early Oropharyngeal SCC. Whether these findings will translate into different treatment strategies based on the upstaged neck has to be further investigated.},

This is a retrospective analysis of patient's charts and tumor tissue. 57 patients were consecutively included and their tumor tissue assembled on a tissue microarray following immunohistochemical analysis. Survival times were estimated by means of Kaplan-Meier analysis. The importance of clinical and immunohistochemical factors for outcome was estimated by cox proportional hazard models. With 88 \% 5-year overall survival, 91 % 5-year disease-specific survival and 91 \% 5-year disease-free survival, respectively, we found excellent survival rates in this surgically treated patient cohort of mainly advanced OPSCC (93 \% AJCC stage III or IV). The only factors positively influencing survival were p16 overexpression as well as p53 negativity and even more pronounced the combination of those biomarkers. Survival analysis of patients classified into three risk categories according to an algorithm based on p16, smoking, T- and N-category revealed a low, intermediate and high-risk group with significant survival differences between the low and the high-risk group. Patients with OPSCC can be successfully treated by surgery and adjuvant RT ± CT with a clear survival benefit of p16 positive, p53 negative patients. We recommend considering a combination of immunohistochemical (p16, p53) and clinical factors (smoking, T- and N-category) for risk stratification.},

Methods: 98/120 (82\%) survivors treated by primary intensity modulated chemoradiation (n=55) or surgery with (n=30) or without (n=13) adjuvant radiotherapy completed and returned the questionnaires. Results: Surgically treated patients complained about significantly less troubles with dry mouth and teeth compared to the non-surgically treated group. Comparing patients treated with surgery alone and those receiving any kind of radiotherapy (primary or adjuvant) the latter group complained about significantly more problems. Patients with p16-positive tumors demonstrated significantly higher tumor stages but significantly better scores in physical and role functions. Conclusions: Early disease can be treated with high longterm QoL by surgery alone. Primary surgery with postoperative RT in selected patients with limited primary tumors and advanced neck disease renders excellent QoL. Our results suggest that IMRT is superior to former radiation techniques with regard to QoL, and should be considered as standard of care in patients undergoing RT for OPSCC. Patients with HPV positive tumors appear to show not only a better outcome but also report on a better QoL.},

Conclusions: A risk model based on multiple factors instead of p16 as single marker can define different risk groups to select patients for treatment de-intensification in future prospective clinical trials.},

  journal = {Respirology},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {22},
  pages = {1133--39},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Daily physical activity (PA) is reduced in patients with COPD. Previous cross-sectional analyses indicate various predictors for a low level of PA including airway obstruction, exacerbations and co-morbidities. However, information from longitudinal studies evaluating PA in the context of disease progression, survival and co-morbidities is scant.

METHODS: In a heterogeneous cohort of COPD patients, we annually assessed the number of steps per day over 1 week and potential determinants including lung function, exacerbations and co-morbidities. Univariable and multivariable mixed effect models were used to investigate associations between the change in steps per day (dependent variable) and possible predictors and their annual changes.

RESULTS: A total of 177 COPD patients (46\% GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) stage 1/2, 38\% stage 3 and 16\% stage 4) with a mean (min/max) follow-up time of 2.7 (1/5) years were annually assessed. The number of steps per day decreased significantly over time (P < 0.001) with a mean annual change of -508 steps. The decrease in activity was significantly associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 ) \% predicted (P = 0.020) but not with annual changes in FEV1 . Hyperinflation, exacerbations, co-morbidities and their annual changes, and survival did not significantly affect change in PA.

CONCLUSION: COPD patients have a substantial decrease of PA over time. This decrease seems to be determined by the degree of airflow limitation. However, patients with a greater annual decline in lung function did not show a greater decrease in PA. The rate of decline in PA did not differ between survivors and non-survivors in this cohort.},

  abstract = {Histopathologic protocols for SLNs are designed to provide maximum information about the potential presence of metastases and minimizing the risk of sampling error. The aim of our study was to assess the 3D-distribution of metastatic tumor cells within SLNs and to develop recommendations for time- and cost-efficient histopathologic work-up. For exact measurement of occult metastases an ultra-high resolution image scanning technology was used to create digital images from the microscopic glass slides and the digital images were examined with a virtual microscope. The x-axis described the maximum diameter right-angled to the y-axis. The y-axis expressed the distance between the afferent and efferent pole and the z-axis was reflecting the sectional plane. Micrometastases were located almost in the middle of the x-axis, closer to the inlet and almost in the center of the z-axis. Using the current standardized protocol for histopathologic work-up, in our cohort 35\% of the micrometastases were found by dividing the SLN into two blocks. By step sectioning at 150$\mu m$ intervals 60\% of micrometastases were found with a second, 70\% with a third and 90\% with a fourth slice. In 2/26 of SLNs (8\%) micrometastases were only found by cutting the entire lymph node. Most of micrometastases are located closer to the inlet of a SLN. The current protocol for SLN evaluation is therefore reasonable. On the other hand the distribution of metastases is not fully predictable and only complete step sectioning of the SLN does allow the identification of all occult disease.},

  journal = {BMC Respiratory Research},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {18},
  number = {210},
  abstract = {Introduction: Although the majority of solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura (SFTP) follow a benign course, up to 30\% of patients suffer from recurrence or metastatic disease. Therefore, several scoring models have been proposed to predict the outcome. However, none of these included immunohistochemical (IHC) markers as possible prognosticators.

Methods: In this prospective multicenter study we collected clinical data and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks of patients with histologically proven SFTP, which had been surgically resected between 2000 und 2015. After systematic and extensive IHC staining on tissue microarrays, the results were analyzed and compared to histo-morphological and clinical data for their possible predictive value.

Results: In total, 78 patients (mean age 61 $\pm$ 11 years) were included. Of these, 9 patients (11\%) had an adverse outcome including SFTP recurrence (n=6), or SFTP-related death (n=3). Mean overall survival was 200 $\pm$ 7.7 months. 1-, 5-, 10-year event-free survival rates were 99\%, 93\% and 62\%, respectively. In the multivariable analysis only MIB-1 proliferation index (Ki-67) $\leq$10\% (HR 12.3, CI 1.1-139.5, p=0.043), $\leq$4 mitoses per 10 high power fields (HR 36.5, CI 1.2-1103.7, p=0.039) and tumor size larger than 10 cm (HR 81.8, CI 1.7-4016.8, p=0.027) were independently associated with adverse outcome.

Conclusions: A high proliferation rate assessed by MIB-1 IHC was associated with impaired outcome. Upon this, we constructed a new score using four variables including MIB-1, which performed better than the traditional scores in our data. This prognostic score could help to better predict outcome of SFTP, but requires external validation.},

  journal = {Acta Neurochirurgica},
  year = {2015},
  volume = {157},
  pages = {1771--7},
  month = {October},
  abstract = {Background: Transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery has gained popularity in the last 2 decades and is becoming a standard technique for resection of pituitary adenomas. In contrast to their ENT colleagues, neurosurgical residents have practically no endoscopic experience when they reach the training stage for transsphenoidal procedures. We have developed an affordable method for repetitive training in endoscopic (and microscopic) work in a narrow channel, allowing training of the basic movements needed for resection of pituitary adenoma. Methods: In collaboration with colleagues in the ENT Department, Cantonal Hospital St. Gall, and the Technical University of Zurich, a three-dimensional model of the nasal cavity was developed and patented. The Egghead model consists of a 3D synthetic reconstruction of the head nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus. A boiled egg represents the sella. For validation, 17 neurosurgical residents from the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Basel, and Department of Neurosurgery, Cantonal Hospital of St. Gall, St. Gall, Switzerland, and two experts performed a standardized procedure mimicking a transsphenoidal pituitary procedure by dissecting a corridor to the egg yolk and resecting it, respecting the surrounding egg white. This procedure was performed under both microscopic and video-endoscopic visualization. A score for the precision and speed of the surgical performance was developed and used. Results: The model allows repetitive training of the resection of the egg yolk under sparing of the egg white after careful opening of the shell. The validation data showed a steeper learning curve using the endoscopic technique than performing the same task using the microscope. After three repetitions, the quality of resection was better with the endoscopic technique. Conclusions: Our model, the Egghead, is affordable, offers tactile feedback and allows infinite repetitions in basic training for pituitary surgery. It can be used for training of advanced neurosurgical residents, who thus far have very few possibilities of acquiring endoscopic experience.},

  abstract = {Aims: Extracts from pine tree bark containing a variety of flavonoids have been used in traditional medicine. Pycnogenol is a proprietary bark extract of the French maritime pine tree (Pinus pinaster ssp. atlantica) that exerts antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-platelet effects. However, the effects of Pycnogenol on endothelial dysfunction, a precursor of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events, remain still elusive. Methods and results: Twenty-three patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) completed this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Patients received Pycnogenol (200 mg/day) for 8 weeks followed by placebo or vice versa on top of standard cardiovascular therapy. Between the two treatment periods, a 2-week washout period was scheduled. At baseline and after each treatment period, endothelial function, non-invasively assessed by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery using high-resolution ultrasound, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, platelet adhesion, and 24 h blood pressure monitoring were evaluated. In CAD patients, Pycnogenol treatment was associated with an improvement of FMD from 5.3 +/- 2.6 to 7.0 +/- 3.1 (P < 0.0001), while no change was observed with placebo (5.4 +/- 2.4 to 4.7 +/- 2.0; P = 0.051). This difference between study groups was significant [estimated treatment effect 2.75; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.75, 3.75, P < 0.0001]. 15-F2t-Isoprostane, an index of oxidative stress, significantly decreased from 0.71 +/- 0.09 to 0.66 +/- 0.13 after Pycnogenol treatment, while no change was observed in the placebo group (mean difference 0.06 pg/mL with an associated 95\% CI (0.01, 0.11), P = 0.012]. Inflammation markers, platelet adhesion, and blood pressure did not change after treatment with Pycnogenol or placebo. Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence that the antioxidant Pycnogenol improves endothelial function in patients with CAD by reducing oxidative stress.

  abstract = {Besides smoking, low or high BMI is associated with chronic lung disease (CLD). It is unclear how CLD is associated with BMI, whether smoking interacts with this association and how the associations differs from the patterns known for lung cancer. Our population comprised 35,212 individuals aged 14-99, who participated in population-based surveys conducted 1977-1993 in Switzerland (mortality-follow-up until 2014). We categorized smokers into never, former, light, heavy; BMI into underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese. Hazard Ratios (HR) were obtained with multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. CLD mortality was strongly associated with underweight. This was mainly due to the effect in men (HR 5.04 [2.63-9.66]) and also prevailed in never smokers (HR 1.81 [1.11-3.00]). Obesity was also associated with CLD mortality (HR men: 1.37 [1.01-1.86], women: 1.39 [0.90-2.17)], but not with lung cancer mortality. In line with lung cancer, for CLD, the BMI-mortality association followed the same shape in all smoking categories suggesting that this association was largely independent of smoking status. The shape of the BMI-mortality-association was inversely linear for lung cancer but followed a U-shape for CLD. Further research should examine This suggests a potentially protective effect of obesity on lung cancer occurrence and the possibly hazardous impact of underweight on CLD development.},

  abstract = {Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used for many indications beyond the original substitution in primary antibody deficiency. Whereas many reports mention adverse reactions, no comparative data exist concerning the incidence of side-effects among the different brands of IVIG. We describe here our experience with the use of different IVIG formulations and their tolerability in a select cohort of 40 patients. The IVIG dose ranged from 0.4 to 3 g/kg/day and was given for 1–2742 days. Fourteen patients (35\%) experienced mild to severe adverse reactions during or within 48 h of administration of standard IVIG preparation, which did not recur after switching to an alternative preparation. Adverse reactions included headache, fever, chills, nausea, emesis, hypotension and muscle cramps. One patient experienced a severe adverse reaction; he had a 3-day headache following IVIG infusion. Among the 16 patients who received alternative preparation initially, none experienced adverse reactions. In conclusion, this study shows that IVIG preparations are not all equally well tolerated in patients. The data suggest that, perhaps to a comparable extent to the preparation itself, the infusion rate has a major effect. If a reduction in the infusion rate does not minimize sideeffects, one should consider switching the IVIG formulation.},

  abstract = {Objective: Up to 9\% of all burn injuries in western countries are been reported to have been caused by self-immolation with suicidal intent and usually involve extensive injuries. We sought to identify differences between suicide burn victims as opposed to those who sustained their injuries accidentally, with regards to injury severity and mortality and determine the possible impact of suicide as a prognostic variable in the context of a scoring system such as the Abbreviated Burns Severity Index (ABSI). Patients and Methods: The data of all burns patients treated at the Specialist Burns Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital Zurich, between 1968 and 2008 were analysed retrospectively. Results: Of the 2813 patients included in the study, 191 were identified as attempted suicides, most commonly involving the use of accelerants. 30\% of all suicide victims had pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses. Suicide victims presented with significantly more extensive burns (53.7\%, +/- 0.98 SEM versus 21.4\%, +/- 0.36 SEM, p <0.0001), had higher total ABSI scores (8.4, +/-0.23 SEM versus 6.6, +/- 0.05 SEM, p< 0.0001) and higher mortality rates (42.9\% (83/191) versus 16.3\% (426/2622)) than accident victims. Furthermore logistic regression revealed suicide to be as significant a predictor of mortality as inhalation injury (OR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.4-3.5, p< 0.0003 and OR 2.4, 95\% CI 1.4-4.0, p<0.0009, respectively). Conclusions: The odds of dying from an attempted suicide are twice as high compared to those of accident patients in the same ABSI category, making suicide a powerful predictor of mortality. We therefore suggest including it as a fixed variable in scoring systems for estimating a patient's mortality after burn injuries, such as the widely used ABSI.},

We reviewed the records of 2813 burns patients treated between January 1968 and December 2008 in the intensive care unit at our institution, aiming to identify emerging discrepancies between the estimated and calculated outcome, based on each of the ABSI variables and the total burn score. The predictive value of each of the defined ABSI variables was confirmed to be highly significant. Univariable and multivariable analysis revealed an exponential increase in odds ratio (OR) for mortality for patients older than 60 years and more than 30\% TBSA burned and showed OR values over 10 times higher than other significant variables like inhalation injury. Nevertheless, the ABSI for the estimation of mortality in our entire patient collective was highly accurate and could not be optimised by adapting the point distribution to the increase in OR. Our data indicates that despite significant changes in patient demographics and medical advances over the past 30 years, the ABSI scoring system is still an accurate and valuable tool in the prediction of burn patient mortality.},

Transient postoperative diabetes insipidus occurred more often after E-operations (17 vs. 5\%, p = 0.03) without significant long term difference. Improved visual outcome showed a more favourable trend in E-cases. The implementation of the endoscopic technique was associated with more surgical complications in the learning phase, however with more improved visual outcome.

  abstract = {Rationale: Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations of GLA-gene leading to reduced $\alpha$-Galactosidase activity and resulting in a progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacylated derivative, globotriaosyl-sphingosine (Lyso-Gb3). Plasma Lyso-Gb3 levels serve as a disease severity and treatment monitoring marker during enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). 
Objectives. We investigated the predictors of lung disease progression in AFD. 
Methods: Adult patients with AFD who have yearly pulmonary function tests between 1999 and 2015 were eligible for this observational study. 
Measurements. Primary outcome measures were the change in z-score of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and FEV1/FVC over time. Plasma Lyso-Gb3 levels and the age of ERT initiation were investigated for their association with lung function decline. 
Main Results: Fifty-three patients (42\% male, median age at diagnosis of AFD 34 [6-61] years in males, 34 [13-67] in females) were included. The greatest decrease of FEV1/FVC z-scores was observed in Classic males (-0.048 per year, 95\% CI (-0.081, -0.014)). For the Later-Onset males (+0.013, (-0.055, 0.082)). For the Classic (-0.008 (-0.035, +0.020)) and Later-Onset females (-0.013, (-0.084, +0.058)), there was no or less relevant decrease. Cigarette smoking (p=0.037) and late ERT initiation (p=0.028) were independently associated with faster FEV1 decline. There was a trend towards a relevant influence of Lyso-Gb3 (p=0.09) on airflow limitation with age. 
Conclusion: Early ERT initiation seems to preserve pulmonary function. Plasma Lyso-Gb3 could be useful as predictor for airflow limitation. Classic males need a closer monitoring of the lung function.},

Although histological evidence of lung involvement has been demonstrated, the functional impact of these changes is less clear. Adult patients with FD who had yearly pulmonary function tests (PFT) at two centres from 1999 thru 2015 were eligible for this observational study. Primary outcome measures were the change in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and FEV1/FVC over time. As secondary outcome we investigated sex, smoking, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), residual enzyme activity, and Mainz Severity Score Index as possible predictors. 95 patients (41\% male, 38.2 $\pm$ 14.5 years) were included. The overall prevalence of bronchial obstruction (BO, (FEV1/FVC < 70\%)) was 46%, with male sex, age and smoking as significant predictors. FEV1 decreased 29 ml per year (95\% CI -36, -22 ml, p<0.0001). FEV1 decline was significantly higher in males (p=0.009) and in patients on ERT (p=0.004). Pulmonary involvement seems to be a relevant manifestation of Fabry disease, and routine PFTs should therefore be included in the multidisciplinary follow-up of these patients, since early treatment initiation may prevent pulmonary disease progression.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The allostatic load (AL) index is a multi-systemic measure of physiologic dysregulation known to be associated with chronic exposure to stress and adverse health outcomes. We examined the relationship between AL and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration in non-institutionalized US adults. Methods: Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988–94) were used to calculate two versions of AL including 9 biomarkers and another two with 14 biomarkers (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, serum cholesterol, serum HDL-cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, sex-specific waist-to-hip ratio, serum albumin, and serum C-reactive protein for AL1, and, additionally body mass index, serum triglyceride, serum creatinine, and serum herpes I & II antibodies for AL2), each set defined by predefined cut-offs or by quartiles. Serum vitamin D concentration was ranked into quartiles. Logistic regression, Poisson regression and linear regression were used to examine the association of serum 25(OH)D concentrations on AL, after adjusting for biological, physiological, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health variables. Results: Odds Ratios (OR) for high AL of the lowest 25(OH)D serum quartile were between 1.45 (95\% CI: 1.28, 1.67) and 1.79 (95\% CI: 1.39, 2.32) for the fully adjusted model, depending on AL version. Inverse relationships between vitamin D serum concentrations were observed for all AL versions and every adjustment. This relationship was consistent after stratification by sex, age or ethnic background. Sensitivity to low 25(OH)D concentrations was highest among the youngest group (20–39 years) with an OR of 2.11 (95\% CI: 1.63, 2.73) for the lowest vitamin D quartile Q1. Conclusions: Vitamin D had a consistent and statistically significant inverse association with all tested models of high AL, which remained consistent after adjusting for biological, socioeconomic, lifestyle and health variables. Our study adds evidence linking low 25(OH)D concentrations with poorer health, further-reaching than bone health.},

  abstract = {Background: Progress in management of congenital heart disease has shifted mortality largely to adulthood. However adult survivors with complex congenital heart disease are not cured and remain at risk of premature death as young adults. Thus, our aim was to describe the evolution and mortality risk of adult patient cohorts with complex congenital heart disease. Methods: Among 12,644 adults with congenital heart disease followed at a single center from 1980-2009, 176 had Eisenmenger syndrome, 76 had unrepaired cyanotic defects, 221 had atrial switch operations for transposition of the great arteries, 158 had congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, 227 had Fontan palliation, and 789 had repaired tetralogy of Fallot. We depict the 30 year evolution of these 6 patient cohorts, analyze survival probabilities in adulthood, and predict future number of deaths through 2029. Results: Since 1980 there has been a steady increase in numbers of patients followed except in cohorts with Eisenmenger syndrome and unrepaired cyanotic defects. Between 1980 and 2009, 308 patients in the study cohorts (19\%) died. At the end of 2009, 85\% of survivors were younger than 50 years. Survival estimates for all cohorts were markedly lower than for the general population, with important differences between cohorts. Over theupcoming two decades, we predict a substantial increase in numbers of deaths among young adults with subaortic right ventricles, Fontan palliation and repaired tetralogy of Fallot. Conclusions: Anticipatory action is needed to prepare clinical services for increasing numbers of young adults at risk of dying from complex congenital heart disease.},

  title = {Large-scale external validation and comparison of prognostic models: An application to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease},
  journal = {BMC Medicine},
  year = {2018},
  volume = {16},
  number = {33},
  abstract = {Background: External validations and comparisons of prognostic models or scores are a pre-requisite for their use in routine clinical care but lacking in most medical fields including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our aim was to externally validate and concurrently compare prognostic scores for 3-year all-cause mortality in mostly multimorbid patients with COPD.

Methods: We relied on 24 cohort studies of the COPD Cohorts Collaborative International Assessment (3CIA) consortium, corresponding to primary, secondary and tertiary care in Europe, the Americas and Japan. They include globally 15762 patients with COPD (1871 deaths and 42203 person-years of follow-up). We used network meta-analysis adapted to multiple score comparison (MSC), following a frequentist two-stage approach; thus, we were able to compare all scores in a single analytical framework accounting for correlations among scores within cohorts. We assessed transitivity, heterogeneity and inconsistency and provided a performance ranking of the prognostic scores.

Results: Depending on data availability, between 2 and 9 prognostic scores could be calculated for each cohort. The BODE score (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea and exercise capacity) had a median AUC of 0.679 [1st quartile-3rd quartile = 0.655-0.733] across cohorts. The ADO score (age, dyspnea and airflow obstruction) showed the best performance for predicting mortality (difference AUC_{ADO} - AUC_{BODE} = 0.015 [95\% confidence interval (CI) = -0.002 to 0.032; p = 0.08) followed by the updated BODE (AUC_{BODE updated} - AUC_{BODE} = 0.008 [95\% CI = -0.005 to +0.022; p = 0.23). The assumption of transitivity was not violated. Heterogeneity across direct comparisons was small and we did not identify any local or global inconsistency. 

Conclusions: Our analyses showed best discriminatory performance for the ADO and updated BODE scores in patients with COPD. A limitation to be addressed in future studies is the extension of MSC network meta-analysis to measures of calibration. MSC network meta-analysis can be applied to prognostic scores in any the medical field to identify the best scores, possibly paving the way for stratified medicine, public health and research.},

Methods: Upper gastrointestinal risk factors and other parameters were extracted from a dedicated electronic database. Patients were contacted with a standardised questionnaire. A structured phone interview was performed in all patients with upper gastrointestinal adverse events. Results: A cohort of 718 patients on combination therapy yielded 87 (12.1\%) patients with prophylactic PPI treatment. Upper gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in 18.4\% patients with and in 11.1\% patients without prophylactic PPI (OR 1.80, P=0.054). Co-treatment with corticosteroids was the main identifiable risk factor for upper gastrointestinal adverse events (adjusted OR 5.45, P=0.014). Conclusion: Individualised prescription of PPI-prophylaxis after PCI in patients on combined antiplatelet therapy based on risk assessment for upper gastrointestinal-bleeding seems to represent an effective measure to minimise upper gastrointestinal adverse events after PCI.},

  abstract = {Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare non-Hodgkin's lymphoma entity with a heterogeneous clinical presentation. Various therapeutic considerations in MCL for younger and elderly patients were used over the past decade. We retrospectively analyzed all 44 patients consecutively treated in a tertiary hospital between 2000 and 2010 with newly diagnosed MCL. Patient characteristics, treatment regimens and biological markers were evaluated with regard to overall survival (OS). Treatment regimens were categorized into internationally accepted intensive standard therapies and less intensive alternative treatment regimens given with palliative intent. Biological markers were correlated with clinical outcome by univariate analysis. The median age of the entire study group was 66 years (range: 42-88), with 23 (52\%) patients $\geq$65 years. Thirty-one (70\%) patients received standard regimens, the remaining 13 (30\%) patients were treated with other, less intensive regimens with palliative intent. With a median follow-up of 5.25 years, the three-year OS rate was 60% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.77]. Patients treated with standard regimens had a three-year survival rate of 77\% (range: 64-94\%). Of these, patients younger than 65 years were observed to have better OS (83\% at 3 years; 95\% CI 68-100\%) than those older than 65 years (69\% at 3 years; 95\% CI 48-99\%). In univariate analysis, the only parameters with a statistically significant prognostic impact on OS were absolute monocyte count as a continuous variable, lactate dehydrogenase and absolute lymphocyte count ($\leq$0.5 $\times$ 109 /l) at diagnosis. In conclusion, our data of an unselected group of patients with newly diagnosed MCL treated at a single centre tertiary hospital are in line with results from larger randomized trials demonstrating an improved OS rate of younger as well as elderly MCL patients within the last decade.},

  abstract = {Background and Study Aims: There is a paucity of literature on beginners’ training and on the connection between patient safety for transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI). It is the aim of this study to retrospectively assess the learning curves and associated complications of neurosurgery residents previously never exposed to TFESI and to compare them to experienced board-certified faculty neurosurgeons (BCFN). 

Material and Methods: Procedure time in minutes (min), dose-area-product (DAP) in cGy*cm2, periprocedural observations and complications in n=354 TFESI for radicular pain secondary to lumbar disc herniation or lumbar spinal stenosis were extracted from operative notes and the electronic infiltration logbook in the per-injection format. Learning curves for residents (n=238) and BCFN (n=116) TFESI in terms of procedure time and DAP were estimated using monotone regression. 

Results: Residents TFESI procedure time and DAP reached BCFN level (4.7 min and 140.2 Gy*cm2) after 67 and 68 cases, respectively. Residents TFESI were unsuccessful in 1.7\%, mostly for severe obesity and hypertrophied facet joints, but no severe complications were noted. Obesity, however, did not result in increased procedure times or radiation exposure in general. Residents were faster and required less fluoroscopy in TFESI of the upper lumbar nerve roots than for L5 or S1 in particular.

Conclusion: The residents learning curve for TFESI in terms of procedure time and radiation exposure can be overcome safely after less than 70 TFESI. An outcome analysis correlating to the interventionalist’s training level would be worth investigating in future studies.},

  abstract = {Background and Study Objective: Interlaminar full-endoscopic diskectomy is a mini- mally invasive surgical alternative to microdiskectomy for the treatment of lumbar disk herniation. The authors analyze their surgical results and learning curves during and after the introductory phase of this surgical technique. Patients and Methods: We present a case review of 76 patients operated on using interlaminar full-endoscopic diskectomy. We retrospectively analyzed two spinal sur- geons’ learning curves in terms of operation time with respect to intraoperative blood loss, conversion rates, complications, infections, length of hospitalization, need for rehabilitation, recurrence rates, pain intensity, and opioid use. Patients’ functional status and Health-related Quality of Life were assessed by follow-up questionnaires for 47 patients, using the North American Spine Society Score and the Short Form 12 in addition to long-term pain intensity, work capacity, and patient satisfaction with the operation. Results: A steady state of the learning curve (operation time) of an experienced spinal surgeon was reached after 40 cases. Supervision by a more experienced surgeon can shorten the learning curve. The rate of conversions (10\%), complications (5\%), and recurrent lumbar disk herniations (28\%) did not negatively affect the long-term outcome in patients operated on before and after the learning phase. Patient satisfac- tion was high. Conclusions: The rate of conversions, complications, and recurrent lumbar disk herniations compared with microdiskectomy combined with the challenging learning curve should be considered before surgeons adopt this procedure. Supervision by an endoscopically experienced spinal surgeon during the introductory phase is highly advisable.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We sought to identify the risk of axillary node involvement in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and to determine whether axillary node assessment is necessary in these patients. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is replacing standard axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for surgical staging of invasive breast cancer. Its use in patients with DCIS versus local excision (LE), observation, and/or breast irradiation remains in question. METHODS: We examined the records of 813 patients with localized DCIS and disease-negative margins after LE who were randomly assigned to no further therapy or to breast irradiation in National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trial B-17 and 1799 patients randomized to receive placebo or tamoxifen after LE + radiotherapy in NSABP trial B-24. An ALND was performed in 253 patients in NSABP B-17 and in 162 in NSABP B-24. RESULTS: We found that in NSABP trial B-17, seven patients developed ipsilateral nodal recurrence (INR). Overall INR rate was 0.83/1000 patient-years. In NSABP B-24, overall INR rate was 0.36/1000 patient-years. INR can be considered a surrogate for axillary involvement at the time of DCIS diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: INR in patients with DCIS treated conservatively is extremely rare. Our findings do not support the routine use of SNB in patients with conservatively treated, localized DCIS.},

  abstract = {Proteasome inhibitor resistance is a challenge for myeloma therapy. Bortezomib targets the Î²5 and Î²1 activity, but not the $\beta$2 activity of the proteasome. Bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells downregulate the activation status of the unfolded protein response, and upregulate $\beta$2 pro-teasome activity. To improve proteasome inhibition in bortezomib-resistant myeloma and to achieve more efficient activation of the unfolded protein response, we have developed LU-102, a selective inhibitor of the Î²2 proteasome activity. LU-102 inhibited the $\beta$2 activity in intact myeloma cells at low micromolar concentrations without relevant co-inhibition of $\beta$1 and $\beta$5 proteasome subunits. In pro-teasome inhibitor-resistant myeloma cells, significantly more potent proteasome inhibition was achieved by bortezomib or carfilzomib in combination with LU-102, compared to bortezomib/carfilzomib alone, resulting in highly synergistic cytotoxic activity of the drug combination via endoplasmatic reticulum stress induced apoptosis. Combining bortezomib/carfilzomib with LU-102 significantly prolonged proteasome inhibition and increased activation of the unfolded protein response and IRE1-1$\alpha$± activity. IRE1-$'alpha$± has recently been shown to control myeloma cell differentiation and bortezomib sensitivity (Leung-Hagesteijn, Cancer Cell 24:3, 289-304). Thus, $\beta$2-selective proteasome inhibition by LU-102 in combination with bortezomib or carfilzomib re-sults in synergistic proteasome inhibition, activation of the unfolded protein response, and cytotoxicity, and overcomes bortezomib/carfilzomib resistance in myeloma cells in vitro.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This report describes interventions undertaken by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) to improve compliance with patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments in the setting of multicenter cancer clinical trials. We describe the effectiveness of several interventions and of observational factors. METHODS: PRO submission rates were analyzed for the following three NSABP protocols: the Study of Raloxifene and Tamoxifen (STAR), B-32, and B-35. Institutions participating in protocol B-35 were randomly assigned to receive automated reminders of upcoming assessments or not. Compliance was analyzed with a logistic repeated measures mixed modeling. RESULTS: Compliance was high in the three protocols, with rates greater than 80\% for nearly all time points. Institutions were a significant source of variability (P < .01). The largest institutions had the highest compliance in STAR (odds ratio [OR] = 0.68 for $<$ 50 participants enrolled and OR = 0.82 for 50 to 99 participants enrolled v larger institutions; P < .001). Midsized institutions had highest compliance in B-32 (OR = 4.63 for 31 to 50 patients enrolled and OR = 3.12 for > 50 patients enrolled v small institutions; P = .007). Compliance increased with participant age in STAR (OR = 0.57, 0.89, and 1.01 for ages < 50, 50 to 60, and 60 to 70 years, respectively, v > 70 years; P < .001). Race was significant in B-32 (OR = 2.63 for white v nonwhite; P < .001) and in STAR (OR = 1.41 for white v nonwhite; P < .001). Treatment group was significant in B-32 (OR = 0.74; P = .006). The B-35 prospective reminder did not improve compliance significantly (P = .30), but in B-32, delinquency sanctions were significant (OR = 1.56; P = .007). CONCLUSION: Compliance in NSABP PRO studies is higher now than a decade ago. Results for compliance initiatives were mixed. Age and race are important factors, but institutional variation remains significant and largely unexplained.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess regional control and survival in primary irradiated oropharyngeal cancer patients with advanced neck disease (≥cN2a) receiving planned neck dissection (PND) irrespective of the nodal response compared to salvage neck dissection (SND) in case of regional persistence or reccurence in relation to tumoral p16 overexpression. 96 consecutive patients treated at the University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland were included. Tissue microarray-based scoring of p16 expression was obtained. 5 years overall (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in the PND and SND cohort were 70 vs. 57 \% (p = 0.20) and 80 vs. 65 \% (p = 0.14), respectively. Regional control in PND and SND achieved 95 vs. 87 \% (p = 0.29), respectively. There was no statistically significant impact of neck treatment (PND vs. SND) on regional control or survival among patients with p16-negative tumors (5 years OS 59 vs. 50 \%, p = 0.66; 5 years DSS 59 vs. 57 \%, p = 0.89) nor among patients with p16-positive tumors (5 years OS 84 vs. 67 \%, p = 0.21; 5 years DSS 95 vs. 81 \%, p = 0.24). The type of neck dissection after primary intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) had no impact on regional control and survival even in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated disease. Therefore we are convinced that based on the accuracy of newer diagnostic modalities the surveillance of a radiologically negative neck after primary chemoradiation (CRT) is oncologically safe irrespective of p16 expression of the tumor.},

  abstract = {Function of the skin lymphatics as well as blood perfusion of a meshed transplant is crucial for the healing. The lymphatic regeneration and arterial perfusion of skin transplants after severe burns of the extremities had been studied in eight patients by microlymphography, laser doppler perfusion imaging and transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurements 1, 6 and 18 months after transplantation. One month after transplantation, only fragmented as well as many giant lymphatic skin vessels were present in the transplant. After 6 months a normal lymphatic network had developed in all grafts. The extension of the dye in the lymphatics decreased from 4.5 (0-16) at 1 month to 3.0 (1-6) mm after 18 months, indicating improved lymph drainage capacity. The permeability of the lymphatics in the graft was normal. After 1 month, median laser flux in the transplant was 155.6\% (105-246\%) of the normal skin but it normalised within 18 months. By contrast, transcutaneous oxygen measurement (TcPO(2)) increased from 44 (21-47) to 55 (50-76) mmHg. In meshed transplants used to cover severely burned skin morphological and functional normal lymphatics develop within 6 months and the initially increased laser flux due to inflammatory reaction normalises. Our results provide important insights into the healing process of skin transplants after burn.},

  abstract = {Objective To analyse whether early arthritis patients who do not fulfil the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) 2010 classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a different course of the disease dependent on whether they can or cannot be classified as RA because of radiographic disease (EULAR task force) at diagnosis.

Methods For this observational study within the Swiss RA cohort SCQM, we included patients with early undifferentiated arthritis (disease duration $\leq 1$ year), who had not received any previous disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria negative patients were separated into two groups (radiographic vs non-radiographic arthritis) depending on whether or not they had radiographic changes defined as erosive disease by a EULAR task force ($\leq 3$ joints with erosions). The primary outcome measure was the radiographic progression detected employing the Ratingen erosion score. Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and DAS-28 were used as secondary outcome measures. The average observation period was 4 years.

Results A total of 592 patients were analysed. 240 were not classifiable as RA by application of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria at baseline. In 57 patients, radiographs at the first visit were not available. 133 patients had radiographic arthritis and 50 non-radiographic arthritis. Treatment was initiated in all patients with DMARDs, mostly methotrexate. No differences in DAS-28 and HAQ scores were found during follow-up. The average erosion scores were higher among patients with initially radiographic arthritis throughout the study. The progression of erosion scores over time, however, was higher in patients with initially non-radiographic arthritis with less subsequent radiological progression (3.3 erosions/year vs 0.4, respectively, p$<$0.0001).

Conclusions The clinical and radiographic course of early undifferentiated arthritis under treatment was not dependent on the presence of erosions in three or more joints (ie, the definition of radiographic disease by the EULAR task force) at diagnosis in our cohort.},

  abstract = {Objective. RA can be categorized into late-onset RA (LORA, >60-65 years) and young-onset RA (YORA, 30-55 years), depending on the patient's age at disease onset. Since the average age of the population is continuously increasing, LORA will most probably gain in importance in the future. Despite this growing importance, LORA has not been the focus of much interest in the past. The aim of this study was to analyse radiographic damage progression of early disease in LORA compared with YORA patients.Methods. We included all patients from the Swiss RA registry, Swiss Clinical Quality Management in RA, with recent-onset arthritis, either RA (disease duration ≤1 year) or undifferentiated arthritis, as diagnosed by the data-entering physician. Patients were followed for 5 years. The cut-off between YORA and LORA was operationally set at 60 years of age. The primary outcome of this study was disease progression and activity, which was assessed based on the 28-joint DAS (DAS28) and the progression of joint erosions using a validated scoring system (Ratingen score).Results. A total of 592 patients with early disease were analysed. The age at disease onset had a Gaussian distribution, with a single peak at 54 years of age; 366 patients were categorized as YORA and 226 as LORA at disease onset. DAS28 scores were significantly higher among LORA as compared with YORA patients (4.8 vs 4.5, P = 0.049). Corticosteroids were used in 68% of LORA patients as a first-line treatment, compared with 25.4\% in YORA patients (χ2 test: 54.58; P < 0.0001). In contrast, DMARDs were used in 100\% of the YORA patients as first-line treatment, compared with 91.2% of the LORA patients. During follow-up, new glucocorticoids, synthetic DMARDs or biologic DMARDs were initiated in 32.8\%, 61.1\% and 14.1\% of all YORA patients and 17.5%, 54.6% and 6.6% of LORA patients, respectively (χ2 test: 7.08, 22.53, 54.4; all P < 0.01). The DAS28 scores decreased in both groups during the observed time period, and the initial differences in disease activity vanished after 6 months and during the subsequent follow-up. The Ratingen score was higher in LORA than in YORA patients at inclusion (12.7 vs 5.6, P < 0.0001). The rate of radiographic progression at 5 years was similar when comparing LORA and YORA (3.3 vs 2.6, respectively, P = 0.64). The Ratingen scores at onset and during follow-up over 5 years did not clearly separate LORA and YORA into two groups, but rather, increased linearly when comparing the patients in groups per decade from 20 to 92 years of age.Conclusion. Our results did not show LORA as a separate subgroup of RA with a different prognosis with regard to radiographic progression.},

  abstract = {The main goal of this study was to analyse whether initial addition of glucocorticoid to DMARD therapy influences the long-term course of the disease in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. All patients from the Swiss RA cohort SCQM with recent-onset arthritis (disease duration $<=1$ year) were analysed. The exposure of interest was the use of glucocorticoids (GCs) at baseline. As primary outcome, we considered clinical and radiographic disease progression, assessed by the disease activity (disease activity score, DAS-28), function (health assessment questionnaire disability index, HAQ-DI) and structural joint damage (Ratingen erosion score). The baseline disease characteristics were compared using standard descriptive statistics. The effects of initial GC use on disease progression during follow-up were estimated using linear mixed models with random slope and random intercept, adjusted for potential confounders. In total, 592 patients with early disease were available, with 4.3 years of follow-up (average). Of these, 363 were initially treated with glucocorticoids (GC patients) and 228 were not (no-GC patients). DAS-28 (4.6 vs. 4.3, p = 0.01) and the HAQ-DI (0.94 vs. 0.82, p = 0.01) were higher at baseline in GC patients, while other prognostic factors were balanced at baseline. Neither the change of DAS-28, of HAQ-DI nor of the development of joint erosions differed between the two groups during follow-up. Escalation of treatment employing biologics was documented in 18.0\% of the no-GC patients and 27.3\% of the GC patients (p $< 0.01$). In this cohort, patients with early RA initially treated with GCs had higher measures of disease activity at baseline in comparison to no-GC patients. Despite a similar course of the disease in GC versus non-GC patients, the higher escalation rate to biologic agents in GC patients may reflect a disease less responsive to therapy in these patients. These data suggest that GC use as part of the initial therapeutic strategy in early RA may prevent a more severe course of the disease in patients with higher clinical disease measures at the start of therapy.},

  abstract = {Background: New ACR/EULAR criteria for the classification of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have recently been proposed. The aim of this cohort study was to examine whether fulfilling these 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria at the first visit has an impact on the clinical course and on the radiographic progression of the disease. Methods: For this observational cohort study, we included patients from the Swiss RA registry SCQM with early RA or undifferentiated arthritis (UA, disease duration ≤1 year), as defined by the treating rheumatologist, who had not received any previous DMARDs. Patients were categorized into two groups depending on whether or not they fulfilled the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria (≥ 6 points versus < 6 points) at the first visit. The primary outcome measures were the evolution of the DAS 28 and of radiographic erosions as measured by the Ratingen score over time. Results: Of the 592 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 352 satisfied the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria at baseline, whereas 240 were not classifiable as definite RA. The ACR/EULAR criteria scores correlated with disease activity at disease onset (R2 = 0.31). DMARD treatment was subsequently initiated in all patients, mostly with MTX. There were no significant differences in the therapeutic strategies between patients fulfilling or not fulfilling the classification criteria. Six months after inclusion, patients fulfilling the ACR/EULAR criteria developed a 39.1\% reduction of DAS28 scores, as compared to a 33.6\% reduction in patients not fulfilling the ACR/EULAR criteria (p=0.0002), independently of their respective treatments. Importantly, the DAS 28 scores were higher in those patients fulfilling the ACR/EULAR criteria (ACR/EULAR positive patients) throughout the observation, as compared to patients not fulfilling them (ACR/EULAR negative patients). Average radiographic progression was higher among ACR/EULAR positive than -negative patients (progression of Ratingen score/year 0.50 vs. 0.32, resp., p=0.03) after 3 years of follow up. Conclusions: Among early RA/UA patients, a score of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria sufficient to classify RA selects patients with worse clinical outcome and more radiographic progression},

In this study, we examined the frequency and outcomes of these complications in this patient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients planned to receive anterior cervical spine surgery between 01.03.2010 and 28.02.2011 at the Department of Neurosurgery, St. Gallen were prospectively included. Patients were evaluated using laryngoscopy, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), voice field measurements and validated questionnaires. RESULTS: From the 53 patients included in the study, 40 had at least one complete follow-up examination. The frequency of postoperative dysphonia due to recurrent nerve palsy was 4/40 (10 \%), although this was temporary in 3 patients. FEES revealed a pathological result in 18.9 \% of patients. Postoperative Swallowing Quality of Life Questionnaire (Swal-QoL) scores were significantly lower. CONCLUSION: At a frequency of 10 \%, dysphonia due to recurrent nerve palsy is a relevant complication in cervical spine surgery, albeit temporary in most cases. Postoperative dysphagia is common and should be evaluated and treated during follow-up.},

Two groups were analyzed consisting of 33 patients after SNB and 29 after elective neck dissection. Subjective impairment and functional shoulder status were assessed with the {Neck Dissection Impairment Index} ({NDII}) questionnaire and the modified individual relative Constant Score. Postoperative complications were retrieved from the clinical charts. Results. The investigated scores were significantly better in the {SNB} group. All postoperative complications occurred in the elective neck dissection group. Conclusion. {SNB} is associated with significantly less postoperative morbidity and better shoulder function than elective neck dissection. This supports our opinion that patients with nodal negative early {SCC} of the oral cavity should be offered {SNB}.},

Methods: Retrospective analysis of a consecutive, single-institutional cohort of patients with PTC larger than 1 cm. Clinical risk scores according to the Metastases, Age, Completeness of Resection, Invasion, Size (MACIS), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), and tumor, node, metastases (TNM) scoring systems were determined. BRAF exon 15 mutation analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. Results: BRAF V600E mutations were found in 75/116 (65\%) PTC. The rates for 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were 92\% and 87\%, 98\% and 96\%, and 96\% and 94\%, respectively. Low MACIS scores were associated with longer OS (10 y 95\% vs 75\%, P = .008), DSS (10 y 100\% vs 89\%, P = .02) and RFS (100\% vs 85\%, P = .006). Comparable survival advantages were observed for patients with early EORTC scores and low TNM stage. BRAF V600E mutation status was not associated with clinicopathologic characteristics of aggressive behavior such as extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastases, higher T-categories, male sex, and greater age. Furthermore, BRAF V600E mutation status was not correlated with clinical risk scores and decreased survival. Conclusion: In concordance with other studies, we did not find a negative prognostic impact of a positive BRAF V600E mutation status on survival. In contrast, the risk algorithms MACIS, EORTC score, and TNM stage were associated with impaired prognosis. Therefore, clinical staging systems represent better tools for risk stratification than BRAF V600E mutation status.},

  abstract = {Background: Involuntary weight loss ({IWL}) is frequent in advanced cancer patients causing compromised anticancer treatment outcomes and function. Cancer cachexia is influenced by nutrition impact symptoms (NIS). The aim of this study was to explore the frequency of NIS in advanced patients and to assess specific interventions guided by a 12-item {NIS} checklist. Methods: Consecutive patients from an outpatient nutrition-fatigue clinic completed the {NIS} checklist. The {NIS} checklist was developed based on literature review and multiprofessional clinical expert consensus. Chart review was performed to detect defined {NIS} typical interventions. Oncology outpatients not seen in the nutrition-fatigue clinic were matched for age, sex, and tumor to serve as controls. Results: In 52 nutrition-fatigue clinic patients, a mixed cancer population [IWL in 2 months 5.96\% (mean)], the five most frequent {NIS} were taste and smell alterations 27\%, constipation 19\%, abdominal pain 14\%, dysphagia 12\%, and epigastric pain 10\%. A statistically significant difference for {NIS} typical interventions in patients with taste and smell alterations (p = 0.04), constipation (p = 0.01), pain (p = 0.0001), and fatigue (p = 0.0004) were found compared to the control population [mixed cancer, 3.53\% {IWL} in 2 months (mean)]. Conclusion: {NIS} are common in advanced cancer patients. The NIS checklist can guide therapeutic nutrition-targeted interventions. The awareness for NIS will likely evoke more research in assessment, impact, and treatment.},

Patients and methods: {DLBCL} patients receiving {FDG-PET}/{CT} during follow-up were analyzed retrospectively. Confirmatory biopsy was mandatory in cases of suspected disease recurrence. Results: Seventy-five patients were analyzed and 23 (30\%) had disease recurrence. The positive predictive value ({PPV}) of {FDG-PET}/{CT} was 0.85. Patients >60 years [P = 0.036, hazard ratio ({HR}) = 3.82, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.02-7.77] and patients with symptoms indicative of a relapse (P = 0.015; {HR} = 4.1; 95\% {CI} 1.20-14.03) had a significantly higher risk for relapse. A risk score on the basis of signs of relapse, age >60 years, or a combination of these factors identified patients at high risk for recurrence ({P} = 0.041). Conclusions: {FDG-PET}/{CT} detects recurrent {DLBCL} after first-line therapy with high PPV. However, it should not be used routinely and if only in selected high-risk patients to reduce radiation burden and costs. On the basis of our retrospective data, {FDG-PET}/{CT} during follow-up is indicated for patients <60 years with clinical signs of relapse and in patients >60 years with and without clinical signs of relapse.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) gained much popularity during the last decade. Although the influence of intraoperative fluid management on patients' outcome has been largely discussed in general, its impact on perioperative complications and length of hospitalization in patients undergoing RALP has not been examined so far. We hypothesized that a more restrictive fluid management might lead to a shortened length of hospitalization and a decreased rate of complications in our patients.METHODS:Retrospective analysis of data of 182 patients undergoing RALP at an University Hospital (first series of RALP performed at the center).RESULTS:The amount of fluid administered was initially normalized for body mass index of the patient and the duration of the operation and additionally corrected for age and the interaction of these variables. The application of crystalloids (multiple linear regression model, estimate = -0.044, p = 0.734) had no effect on the length of hospitalization, whereas a negative effect was found for colloids (estimate = -8.317, p = 0.021). Additionally, a significant interaction term between age and the amount of colloid applied (estimate = 0.129, p = 0.028) was calculated. Evaluation of the influence of intraoperative fluid administration using multiple logistic regression models corrected for body mass index, duration of the surgery and additionally for age revealed a negative effect of crystalloids on the incidence of an anastomotic leak between bladder and urethra (estimate = -23.86, p = 0.0167), with a significant interaction term between age and the amount of crystalloids (estimate = 0.396, p = 0.0134). Colloids had no significant effect on this particular complication (estimate = 1.887, p = 0.524). Intraoperative blood loss did not alter the incidence of an anastomotic leak (estimate = 0.0010, p = 0.0862), nor did it affect the length of hospitalization (estimate = 0.0001, p = 0.3511).CONCLUSIONS:In accordance to the findings of our study, we suggest that a standardized, more restrictive fluid management might be beneficial in patients undergoing RALP. In older patients this measure would be able to shorten the length of hospitalization and to decrease the incidence of anastomosis leakage as a major complication.},

  abstract = {Background: Adult body height is largely determined by genetics, but also by dietary factors, which in turn depend on socioeconomic status and lifestyle. We examined the association between adult body height and mortality in Switzerland, a country with three main language regions with different cultural background.

Methods: We included 16,831 men and 18,654 women, who participated in Swiss population-based health surveys conducted 1977-1993 and who were followed up until end of 2008. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were computed to examine the association of body height with overall, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality.

Results: We observed a positive association between adult body height and all-cause mortality in women (HR = 1.34, 95\% CI 1.10-1.62, tallest vs. average women). In men, mortality risk decreased with increasing height, with shortest men tending to have higher (1.06, 0.94-1.19) and tallest men a lower (0.94, 0.77-1.14) risk compared with men of average height (p-trend 0.0001). Body height was associated with cancer mortality in women, such that tallest women had a higher risk of dying from cancer than women of average height (1.37, 1.02-1.84), but there was no such association in men (0.95, 0.69-1.30). In both sexes, height was not associated with cardiovascular mortality in a statistically significant manner.

Conclusion: Our study does not support an inverse association of body height with all-cause mortality. On the contrary, our data suggests a higher overall risk in taller women, mainly driven by a positive association between body height and cancer mortality.},

  abstract = {Background: The optimal conduct of follow-up (FU) of patients with osteosarcoma is uncertain. In the absence of any formal validation of optimal timing and method of surveillance, guidance is provided by oncology societies' recommendations. FU is designed to detect either local recurrence or metastatic disease at a time when early treatment is still possible and might be effective. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 101 patients with high-grade extremity osteosarcoma in a single centre. Chest x-ray (CXR) was used as routine surveillance method; however patients with initial lung metastases or previous suspicious findings had computed tomography (CT) scans. Results: With a median FU time of 30.7 months 34 patients relapsed. Relapse–free survival after 5 years was 61\% (CI 52\%; 73\%), late relapses occurred in only two patients between 2 and 5 years of FU. Twenty-five of the 34 relapses were detected at routine FU appointments. All 8 local recurrences were noted clinically. Twenty-two patients had metastases confined to the lungs, either detected on CXR or CT. Thirty-two percent of patients with lung metastases only were salvaged successfully. Conclusions: Routine FU in high-grade osteosarcoma results in clinical detection of local relapse, and detection of lung metastases by CXR at a time when metastatectomy is possible. The optimal time interval for FU appointments is not known, however we recommend more frequent surveillance visits during the two years after treatment. We hypothesize that routine CT scans are not required and propose CXR for detection of lung metastases.},

  abstract = {Background: There are neither prospective data nor agreement on the optimal routine follow-up procedures in patients treated for soft tissue sarcoma of the limb. Methods: Data on 174 consecutive patients with a soft tissue sarcoma of the limb undergoing follow-up by oncologists at a single centre from 2003 to 2009 were included in this analysis. The rate and site of recurrence and mode of detection were analysed. Outcome of the patients was assessed. Results: Eighty-two patients (47\%) experienced relapse of any type. Isolated local recurrence occurred in 26 patients and local relapse with synchronous pulmonary metastases in five patients. Local recurrences were detected clinically in 30 of these 31 patients; magnetic resonance imaging identified only one local recurrence. Twenty-eight patients developed isolated lung metastases; in nine patients these were amenable to resections, seven of whom are currently free of disease after treatment. Lung metastases were detected by chest x-ray (CXR) in 19 patients, computed tomography scanning in 3 patients, and clinically in 11 patients. Twenty-three patients developed non-pulmonary metastases. More than 80\% of relapses occurred in the first 2 years of follow-up; however, later recurrences were also observed. Conclusions: Routine follow-up CXR can detect lung metastases suitable for surgical resection, although the optimal interval of imaging has yet to be defined. Local relapse is almost always detected by patients or physicians, and routine scanning of the primary site is of doubtful benefit. Patient and physician education to detect local relapse may be helpful. Prospective evaluation of follow-up is recommended.},

METHODS: Medical histories of the patients were screened for response, event-free survival ({EFS}) and overall survival ({OS}). Pre-transplant variables were analysed to identify possible prognostic risk factors. RESULTS: Overall, 182 {ASCT} were performed in 120 patients with {MM} from 2002 to 2007. Treatment-related mortality ({TRM}) was 0.5\%. Median {EFS} was 23.1 months (95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 19.4 - 28.4) and median {OS} was 49.8 months (95\%{CI}: 43.7 - not reached) in the whole patient population. The median {OS} in patients who received one {ASCT} was 46.4 months (95\%{CI}: 35.2 - not reached), and 63.7 months (95\%{CI}: 48.9 - not reached) in patients who underwent double {ASCT}.

We retrospectively evaluated the impact of pegfilgrastim compared to filgrastim on neutrophil engraftment, hospital stay, and supportive measures in patients with multiple myeloma after conditioning with Melphalan 200 (Mel200) followed by APBSCT. Ninety-two APBSCT after Mel200 treatment were performed in 72 patients between January 2006 and December 2009 at our institution. Patients received either single-dose pegfilgrastim (n=46; 50\%), or daily filgrastim (n=46; 50\%) after APBSCT (median duration of filgrastim use, 9 days; range, 3-14 days). Duration of neutropenia grade IV was shorter with pegfilgrastim compared with filgrastim (median, 5 days (range, 3-14 days) versus 6 days (range, 3-9 days), p=0.0079). The length of hospitalization differed significantly (pegfilgrastim (median, 14.5 days; range, 11-47 days) versus filgrastim (median, 15.5 days; range, 12-64 days), p=0.024). Pegfilgrastim-treated patients had less red blood cell transfusions (median, 0 transfusions (range, 0-10) versus 0.5 transfusions (range, 0-9), p=0.00065). Pegfilgrastim was associated with reduced cost of the treatment procedure compared with filgrastim (p=0.031). Pegfilgrastim appears to be at least equivalent to filgrastim without additional expenditure in myeloma patients treated with Mel200 and APBSCT.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An outcome assessment was performed of patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) treated in second or third line with floxuridine (FUDR)-based hepatic artery infusion (HAI). METHODS: Twenty-three patients who were pretreated with systemic (immuno)chemotherapy received FUDR-HAI alone or combined with systemic chemotherapy. We reviewed patient charts and our prospective patient database for survival and associated risk factors. RESULTS: Patients received FUDR-HAI for unresectable CRLM from January 2000 to September 2010. Twelve patients (52\%) received concurrent systemic chemotherapy. Median overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and hepatic PFS were 15.6 months (range, 2.5-55.7 months), 3.9 months (range, 0.7-55.7 months), and 5.5 months (range, 1.6-55.7 months), respectively. The liver resection rate after HAI was 35\%. PFS was better in patients undergoing secondary resection than in patients without resection (hazard ratio [HR] 0.21; 95% confidence interval [95\% CI] 0.07-0.66; P = 0.0034), while OS showed a trend toward improvement (HR 0.4; 95\% CI 0.13-1.2; P = 0.09). No differences were observed in OS (P = 0.69) or PFS (P = 0.086) in patients who received FUDR-HAI alone compared with patients treated with combined regional and systemic chemotherapy. No statistically significant differences were seen in patients previously treated with one chemotherapy line compared with patients treated with two lines. Presence of extrahepatic disease was a negative risk factor for PFS (liver-only disease: HR 0.03; 95\% CI 0.0032-0.28; P < 0.0001). Toxicities were manageable with dose modifications and supportive measures. CONCLUSIONS: FUDR-HAI improves PFS and results in a trend toward improved OS in selected patients able to undergo liver resection after tumor is downsized.},

We evaluated the impact of concomitant statin medication on the response and survival of patients with diffuse large {B} cell lymphoma ({DLBCL}) receiving rituximab-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone ({R-CHOP}) as first-line therapy. Medical histories of patients with {DLBCL} who were treated with {R-CHOP} as first-line therapy were assessed for concomitant statin use, response after completion of chemotherapy, event-free survival ({EFS}), and overall survival ({OS}). Furthermore, 2-[(18)F]fluor-2-deoxyglucose {(FDG)-PET/CT} results after completion of first-line therapy were compared between the groups. Overall, 145 patients with {DLBCL} treated with {R-CHOP} from January 2001 to December 2009 were analyzed. Twenty-one (15%) patients received statins throughout therapy. Five-year {EFS} was 67.3% in patients without statins compared with 79% in patients receiving statins during {R-CHOP} ({HR}, 0.47; 95% {CI}, 0.15-1.54, p = 0.2). Five-year {OS} was 81.4% for patients without statins compared with 93.3% for patients taking statins ({HR}, 0.58; 95% {CI} 0.07-4.55, p = 0.6). There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of complete remissions between the two groups (75% in the non-statin group versus 86% in the statin group, p = 0.45). A trend toward a lower rate of complete metabolic responses in {FDG-PET/CT} after chemotherapy was seen in patients without statin medication compared with the patients taking statins (84% versus 92%, p = 0.068). Concomitant statin use had no adverse impact on response to chemotherapy, {EFS}, and {OS} in patients treated with {R-CHOP} for {DLBCL}.},

Methods: We reviewed patient charts and our prospective transplantation database for clinical data from the post-transplant period.

Results: Fourteen (26\%) patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and 40 (74\%) patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma were analyzed. Thirty-four (68\%) patients received single-dose pegfilgrastim (6 mg), and 20 (32\%) patients received daily filgrastim (5 $\mu$g/kg) after {APBSCT}. No differences were observed regarding duration of neutropenia grade 4 (pegfilgrastim median 7 days/filgrastim median 8 days; p = 0.13), thrombocytopenia grade 4 (7/9.5 days, respectively; p = 0.21), fever (4.5/2 days; p = 0.057), intravenous antibiotic treatment (11/10 days; p = 0.75) or length of hospital stay (16.5/16 days; p = 0.27) between the groups. The use of pegfilgrastim resulted in 12\% higher treatment-related costs when compared to filgrastim, without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.38). Conclusion: Pegfilgrastim appears to be equivalent to filgrastim after high-dose BEAM followed by APBSCT in the treatment of lymphoma patients.},

METHODS: Patient charts and our prospective ASCT database were assessed for the impact of documented variables on event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), including salvage and conditioning regimens used, and PET/CT results before and after ASCT. RESULTS: Overall, 180 patients with NHL (n = 134; 74\%) or HL (n = 46; 26\%) received ASCT from December 2000 to May 2011. Of the NHL patients, 59 (44\%) had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Conditioning was mainly performed with cyclophosphamide, carmustine, etoposide (CBV) (n = 72; 40\%) or carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan (BEAM) (n = 103; 57\%). Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 1.7%. Outcome data are in line with previously reported studies, especially the data for salvage treatment and BEAM conditioning in DLBCL patients confirmed the outcome reported recently in a phase III study. Positive pre- and post-transplantation PET/CT was an adverse risk factor for survival (PET/CT+ before ASCT: hazard ratio (HR): 2.65 (1.11 - 6.33), p = 0.029; PET/CT+ after ASCT: HR: 7.11 (2.76 - 18.34), p <0.0001). Other risk factors for survival were primary refractory disease, initial lymphoma stage, number of previous chemotherapy lines, and high amounts of blood product transfusions. CONCLUSIONS: Conditioning with CBV or BEAM and subsequent ASCT was feasible and effective. Initial lymphoma stage and number of previous treatment lines were identified as independent risk factors for EFS in DLBCL and HL patients.},

  number = {35},
  abstract = {Background: Despite physical activity (PA) being recognized as a critically important factor for good physical and mental health already early in life and throughout the life course, prospective data on activity behavior during the preschool years remains scarce. This study examined trajectories and determinants of levels and change in total PA (TPA), moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in a representative sample of Swiss preschoolers.
Methods: Data were drawn from the Swiss Preschoolers’ Health Study (SPLASHY), a multi-site prospective cohort study including 555 children (53\% boys) aged two-to-six years at baseline. A follow-up was conducted after 12 months. Activity behavior was measured using accelerometers. Information on 35 potential determinants from different socio-ecological domains was either directly measured or parent-reported. Trajectories of TPA, MVPA and SB over time were described for boys and girls. Linear mixed models were used to investigate factors that predicted levels and change in TPA, MVPA and SB.
Results: All children were sufficiently physically active according to published recommendations for preschoolers. Trajectory profiles revealed a marked increase in TPA and MVPA in boys and girls whereas SB remained fairly stable over time. Mixed modeling demonstrated that variables most relevant to determining PA levels were sex, age and activity temperament (all positively associated). Together with gross motor skills, birth weight, family structure (only for TPA) and season (only for MVPA), these factors accounted for 26 and 32\% of total variance explained in TPA and MVPA, respectively. Activity temperament emerged as the strongest determinant of SB (negative association) and explained with sex, season and family structure 20\% of total variance in SB. The presence of older siblings was the only factor that predicted change in PA over time.
Conclusions: In this healthy physically active cohort of preschoolers, non-modifiable individual-level factors had the greatest influence on PA. The limited success of this and previous studies to identify modifiable determinants and the finding that most preschoolers were sufficiently active suggest that future attempts should provide insights into how preschoolers’ activity levels can be maintained and fostered to prevent subsequent harmful declines attributable, amongst others, to educational transitions. Thus, good-quality longitudinal studies are needed.},

  abstract = {One night of a sleep study is the standard for diagnosis and exclusion of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Single testing requires high sensitivity of the test method and a stable disease of interest to warrant a low rate of false negative tests. OSA is diagnosed and graded by conventional thresholds of apnoeas and hypopnoeas per hour of sleep and treatment is usually initiated in the presence of symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess night-to-night variability of OSA to reassess the current practice.
77 patients previously diagnosed with OSA, randomised to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) withdrawal within four trials, performed nightly pulse-oximetry over two weeks while off CPAP. The main outcome of interest was the coefficient of variation (CV) of the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) marking night-to-night variability in OSA. OSA was categorised according to conventional thresholds using ODI (no OSA: <5/h, mild 5-15/h, moderate 15-30/h and severe >30/h).
High night-to-night variability of OSA was evidenced by a CV of ODI of 31.1\% (SD16.5). 
Differences in ODI of >10/h between nights were found in 84.4\% and shifts in OSA severity-category in 77.9\% of patients. The probability of missing moderate OSA was up to 60\%. Variability was higher in less severe OSA. 
OSA shows a considerable night-to-night variability. Single-night diagnostic sleep studies are prone to miscategorise OSA if arbitrary thresholds are used. Thus treatment decisions should be based less on the conventional derivatives from sleep studies, especially in patients with less severe OSA.},

Ultrasound-guided FNAC showed the smallest percentage of overstaged patients, 7\%, versus 16\% with PET/CT, 13\% with CT, and 13\% with ultrasound. The rate of understaged patients was comparable between the imaging modalities. With regard to the endpoint N0 versus N+ there were no statistically significant differences to be found. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided FNAC seems to correlate best with histologic staging compared with PET/CT and CT. None of the modality is reliable enough to replace elective neck treatment in cN0 necks.},

Differences in median progression-free survival (PFS) for first- (PFS1) and second-line treatment (PFS2), and for the combined PFS (PFS1 plus PFS2) were examined using weighted linear regression. Results: In the pooled analysis encompassing 853 patients, the median combined PFS for first-line sunitinib and 2nd-line sorafenib (SuSo) was 12.1 months compared with 15.4 months for the reverse sequence (SoSu; 95\% CI for difference 1.45-5.12, p = 0.0013). Regarding first-line treatment, no significant difference in PFS1 was noted regardless of which drug was initially used (0.62 months average increase on sorafenib, 95\% CI for difference -1.01 to 2.26, p = 0.43). In second-line treatment, sunitinib showed a significantly longer PFS2 than sorafenib (average increase 2.66 months, 95\% CI 1.02-4.3, p = 0.003). Conclusion: The SoSu sequence translates into a longer combined PFS compared to the SuSo sequence. Predominantly the superiority of sunitinib regarding PFS2 contributed to the longer combined PFS in sequential use.},

  journal = {CHEST},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {152},
  pages = {1179--1187},
  abstract = {Background: Several cross-sectional and short-term studies suggest that patient-reported outcomes (PROs) may be useful to (help) predict COPD exacerbations but evidence from long-term prospective cohort studies is missing. Our aim was to assess if PROs add to the prediction of exacerbations. 

Methods: 408 primary care COPD patients participated in the multicenter prospective ICE COLD ERIC cohort. PROs included the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Feeling Thermometer and the LASA Physical Activity Questionnaire (LAPAQ). Exacerbations during 4.5 years were adjudicated by experts. We used negative binomial regression to assess the association between PROs and exacerbations while considering age, sex, airflow obstruction, previous exacerbations and smoking status. We then assessed if adding PROs improved the predictive properties of widely used indices.

Results: Lower levels of dyspnea, fatigue and anxiety and higher levels of physical activities were associated with lower risk of experiencing exacerbations (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.90, 95\% CI 0.84, 0.97, p=.01; 0.93, CI 0.86, 1.00, p=0.04; 1.03, CI 1.00, 1.06, p=.03; 0.93, CI 0.87, 0.99, p=.04). The best prediction was when LAPAQ was added to the BODEx index (area under curve ∆+0.02, from 0.72 to 0.74). However, this increase was not clinically relevant (net reclassification improvement 0.03, 95\% CI -0.03, 0.08).

Conclusions: Some domains of PROs are independently associated with exacerbations but do not lead to clearly improved prediction when added to established indices to predict exacerbations. There is still much room for improvement in the prediction of exacerbations.},

  abstract = {Background: Since traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with increased risk for acute cardiovascular events, current guidelines recommend acetaminophen as the first-line analgesic of choice on the assumption of its greater cardiovascular safety. Data from randomized clinical trials prospectively addressing cardiovascular safety of acetaminophen, however, are still lacking, in particular in patients at increased cardiovascular risk. Hence, it was the aim of this study to evaluate the safety of acetaminophen in patients with coronary artery disease. Methods and Results: 33 patients with coronary artery disease were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study and received acetaminophen (1g TID) on top of standard cardiovascular therapy for 2 weeks. Ambulatory blood pressure, heart rate, endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatation, platelet function, endothelial progenitor cells, markers of the renin-angiotensin-system, inflammation and oxidative-stress were determined at baseline and after each treatment period. Treatment with acetaminophen resulted in a significant increase of mean systolic (from 122.4±11.9 to 125.3±12.0 mmHg, p=0.007 vs placebo) and diastolic (from 73.2±6.9 to 75.4±7.9 mmHg, p=0.015 vs. BL, p=0.008 vs. placebo) ambulatory blood pressure. On the other hand, heart rate, endothelial function, early endothelial progenitor cells and platelet function did not change. Conclusions: As this study for the first time demonstrates that acetaminophen induces a significant increase in ambulatory blood pressure in patients with coronary artery disease, the use of acetaminophen should be as rigorously evaluated as traditional {NSAID}s and {COX}-2 inhibitors, in patients at increased cardiovascular risk in particular.

However, they are often discrepant, as several factors including gender influence their relationship. We recently found excessively high serum levels of soluble Klotho (sKl) in acromegalic patients, which depended on GH to a comparable extent as IGF-1. To further elucidate the relationship between GH and sKl, we examined the effect of gender on sKl in patients with untreated acromegaly. PATIENTS AND DESIGN: We determined GH, IGF-1, and sKl in sera of 62 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly (31 females/31 males, aged 20-85 years). RESULTS: For their given GH excess at presentation with acromegaly, females had lower IGF-1 (490 $\pm$ 33 vs 604$\pm$33 ng/ml, p=0.02), but higher sKl (5171$\pm$590 vs 3439$\pm$431 pg/ml [mean±$\pm$SE], p=0.02) levels than males. In multiple regression analysis, IGF-1 was closely associated with logGH (estimate 139, SE 47, p=0.005) and BMI (estimate 14.2, SE 4.8, p=0.005). sKl was closely associated with logGH (estimate 3088, SE 652, p=0.0001) and gender (estimate 2034, SE 612, p=0.002), and to a lesser extent with BMI (estimate 174, SE 66, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: For a given GH status, sKl concentrations are higher and IGF-1 concentrations are lower in women than in men. GH is the strongest predictor for both sKl and IGF-1, but gender needs to be considered when using these parameters for monitoring acromegalic patients.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: The potential of avoiding a secondary surgery for therapeutic neck dissection (TND) by sentinel node (SN) positivity makes the intraoperative evaluation of SNs an attractive option. The aim of this study was to analyze accuracy of intraoperative frozen section (FS) for detection of occult metastases in a large single institutional patient cohort undergoing SN-biopsy. Methods: Between 2000 and 2010, 92 consecutive patients with early stage oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (cT1/cT2/cN0) were prospectively enrolled. Detection rate of occult metastases by monoslice FS was compared with the definitive histopathologic work up by step serial sectioning (SSS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). In case of SN-positivity on FS TND was performed in the same narcosis. Results: 15/92 patients revealed positive SNs by FS compared to 34/92 after SSS and IHC. Sensitivity, NPV and FNR for the detection of all sizes of metastases by FS was 47, 77, and 52\%, for isolated tumor cells (ITC) 8, 86, 92\%, for micrometastases 43, 90, 57\%, and for macro- metastases 93, 98, 7\%. Conclusion: Sensitivity of FS by the monoslice depends on the metastases size and allows a single-stage procedure in half of the SN-positive patients. To improve sensitivity for small tumor deposits either a multislice-technique or molecular methods are needed.},

  volume = {5},
  number = {307},
  abstract = {Background: Medication therapy is commonly accepted as the initial treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the surgical treatment with the highest efficacy, but is considered as last tier therapy for patients with medication refractory pain or for those with unbearable side effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of symptom duration on outcome. 

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted from 2001 through 2012. Patients were categorized according to Burchiel’s “Classification scheme for facial pains commonly encountered in neurosurgical practice”. Demographical, disease and treatment data as well as surgical data including complications and outcome were recorded and analyzed. 

Results: In total, 65 patients were included. Distribution of diagnoses was as follows: TN type 1 (>50% episodic pain) n=54, TN type 2 ($>$50\% constant pain) n=4, neuropathic TN n=1, symptomatic TN due to multiple sclerosis n=3, post herpetic n=2. Onset of disease to surgery was on average 7 years (<1-21 years). Shorter time from disease onset to surgery had a statistically significant association with a pain-free outcome in only TN type 1 patients (6 vs. 13 years, p=0.01). Overall success rate in TN1 was 88.9\%. Overall mortality and morbidity rate were 3%. Overall complication rate was 13.5%. 
Conclusion: Earlier MVD was significantly associated with better outcome. Patients should be informed about the option of MVD at an early stage of disease.},

  abstract = {Pharmacotherapy represents a desirable potential therapeutic alternative for patients with obstructive sleep apnoea
(OSA). We aimed to summarize evidence on the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in adults with OSA and delineate the
underlying mechanisms. Seven Databases were systematically screened for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from
their inception to September 2018. According to a pre-registered study protocol (PROSPERO-ID-CRD42018086446)
network meta-analysis was performed to obtain intervention effects on the apnoea-hypopnoea-index (AHI) based on
data extracted from published reports. We identified 58 RCTs (n=1,710 patients) investigating 44 different drugs or
drug-combinations. Interventions were classified into seven pathomechanism-groups and summarized narratively. A
meta-analysis of 17 trials for seven drugs (acetazolamide, donepezil, mirtazapine, ondansetron, paroxetine,
protriptyline, theophylline) indicated a small effect for acetazolamide (mean difference in AHI −9.6/h [−17.7;−1.4];
p=0.02). In the network meta-analysis (I2=50\%) nine drugs (tramazoline, liraglutide, spironolactone/furosemide,
acetazolamide, dronabinol, zonisamide, phentermine, spironolactone, and ondansetron/fluoxetine) significantly
lowered the AHI compared to placebo. Although some trials indicate favorable outcomes, these results are only valid
for distinctive OSA-phenotypes or were not clinically significant. The effect sizes were small, the majority of trials were
not adequately powered. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend any pharmacotherapy for OSA and no
phase-III trials are available.},

  abstract = {Early diagnosis and treatment of acute cellular rejection (ACR) may improve long-term outcome for lung transplant recipients (LTRs). Cytokines have become valuable diagnostic tools in many medical fields. The role of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytokines is of unknown value to diagnose ACR and distinguish rejection from infection. We hypothesized that distinct cytokine patterns obtained by surveillance bronchoscopies during the first year after transplantation are associated with ACR and microbiologic findings. We retrospectively analyzed data from 319 patients undergoing lung transplantation at University Hospital Zurich from 1998 to 2016. We compared levels of IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ and TNF-α in 747 BAL samples with transbronchial biopsies (TBB) and microbiologic results from surveillance bronchoscopies. We aimed to define reference values that would allow distinction between four specific groups “ACR”, “infection”, “combined ACR and infection” and “no pathologic process”. No definitive pattern was identified. Given the overlap between groups, these four cytokines are not suitable diagnostic markers for ACR or infection after lung transplantation.},
